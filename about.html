            <h2>-->Hydrogen Transition Energy</h2>
            <div class="img">

            <p>The transition energy of hydrogen refers to the energy required to move an electron from one energy level (or orbit) to another within the hydrogen atom. In the Bohr model of the hydrogen atom, the energy levels are quantized, meaning they can only have certain discrete values.
            <br><br>
            The formula to calculate the transition energy between two energy levels in the hydrogen atom is given by the Rydberg formula:
                <pre>
                    E = -R(1/n<sub>i</sub><sup>2</sup> - 1/n<sub>f</sub><sup>2</sup>)   
                    where:
                    E is the transition energy,
                    R is the Rydberg constant for hydrogen (2.18 * 10<sup>-18</sup>J),
                    n<sub>i</sub> is the initial energy level (quantum number),
                    n<sub>f</sub> is the final energy level (quantum number).
                </pre>
            This formula shows that the transition energy depends on the difference in the reciprocals of the squares of the initial and final energy levels. As the electron transitions to a lower energy level (closer to the nucleus), it releases energy, typically in the form of a photon. Conversely, if it transitions to a higher energy level, it absorbs energy, often in the form of a photon.
            <br><br>
            This formula is fundamental in understanding the spectral lines of hydrogen and in spectroscopy in general. It provides a way to calculate the energy of emitted or absorbed photons during electronic transitions within the hydrogen atom.

            <h2>-->Wavelength</h2>
            <div class="img">

            </div>
            <p>Wavelength is a fundamental concept in wave physics, referring to the distance between two successive peaks (or troughs) of a wave. It's commonly denoted by the Greek letter lambda (λ).
            <br><br>
            The wavelength depends on the type of wave and the medium through which it travels. For example:
            <br>   
            <b>1. Electromagnetic Waves (such as light):</b> In a vacuum, light travels at a constant speed, denoted by c (approximately 3*10<sup>8</sup> metres per second).The relationship between the wavelength (λ), frequency (f), and speed of light (c) is given by the equation c = f * λ. So, as the wavelength increases, the frequency decreases, and vice versa. <br><br>
            <b>2. Sound Waves:</b> In a medium like air, sound waves propagate through compression and rarefaction of air molecules. The wavelength of a sound wave depends on factors such as the temperature, pressure, and composition of the medium. In general, longer wavelengths correspond to lower frequencies, and vice versa. <br><br>
            <b>3. Water Waves:</b> Waves on the surface of water also have wavelengths, which are influenced by factors such as wind speed, water depth, and the size and strength of the disturbance causing the wave. <br><br>
            Wavelength is an essential parameter in understanding the behavior of waves, including phenomena like diffraction, interference, and refraction. It's measured in units such as meters (m) for electromagnetic waves and sound waves, or other appropriate units depending on the specific context.

            <h2>-->Electromagnetic Spectrum</h2>
            <div class="img">

            <p>The electromagnetic spectrum is the range of all possible frequencies of electromagnetic radiation, which includes radio waves, microwaves, infrared radiation, visible light, ultraviolet radiation, X-rays, and gamma rays. These different types of radiation have varying wavelengths and energies.
            <br><br>
            Here's an overview of the regions of the electromagnetic spectrum, listed in order of increasing frequency (or decreasing wavelength) and increasing energy:
            <br>
            <b>1. Radio Waves:</b> These waves have the longest wavelengths and lowest frequencies in the electromagnetic spectrum. They are commonly used for communication, including radio broadcasting, television, and cell phones. <br><br>
            <b>2. Microwaves:</b> Microwaves have shorter wavelengths and higher frequencies than radio waves. They are used in microwave ovens for cooking, in telecommunications, and in radar applications. <br><br>
            <b>3. Infrared Radiation:</b> Infrared radiation has wavelengths longer than visible light but shorter than microwaves. It's commonly associated with heat and is used in various applications such as infrared heating, night vision technology, and infrared spectroscopy. <br><br>
            <b>4. Visible Light:</b> Visible light is the part of the electromagnetic spectrum that is visible to the human eye. It consists of different colors, each corresponding to a different wavelength. The colors of visible light, in order of increasing frequency, are red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. <br><br>
            <b>5. Ultraviolet (UV) Radiation:</b> Ultraviolet radiation has shorter wavelengths and higher frequencies than visible light. It is not visible to the human eye but is present in sunlight. UV radiation is responsible for causing sunburn and is used in applications such as sterilization and fluorescent lighting. <br><br>
            <b>6. X-rays:</b> X-rays have shorter wavelengths and higher energies than UV radiation. They are used in medical imaging (X-ray radiography and computed tomography), airport security scanning, and industrial testing. <br><br>
            <b>7. Gamma Rays:</b> Gamma rays have the shortest wavelengths and highest energies in the electromagnetic spectrum. They are produced by radioactive decay and nuclear reactions and are used in cancer treatment (gamma knife) and sterilization processes.
            <br><br>
            Each region of the electromagnetic spectrum has unique properties and applications, ranging from communication and imaging to medical treatment and scientific research.
